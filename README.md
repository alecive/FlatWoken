FlatWoken
=========
I've found this amazing icon set for my linux, and I decide I'll try to make some new icons and help with developing.
Here are my submitted icons for now, please review it and let me know will they merge in main repository.
I've made missing icons mainly for KDE, but some of them may be used for other DE-s.
I know that some of them are not perfect, but feel free to modify them by your desire.
